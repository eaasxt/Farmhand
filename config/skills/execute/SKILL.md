# Execute — Parallel Execution Orchestrator

Picks up existing beads and executes them with multiple parallel agents.

## When This Applies

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Beads exist, ready to execute | Run /execute |
| User says "execute" or "run" | Run /execute |
| User says "start working" | Run /execute |
| Resume after planning | Run /execute |

---

## Prerequisites

Before running /execute:
1. Beads must exist in `.beads/`
2. At least one bead must be in `ready` status
3. Agent Mail MCP must be available

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Setup

```markdown
1. Register as orchestrator:
   - ensure_project(human_key=<project_path>)
   - register_agent(name="Coordinator", program="claude-code", model=<model>)

2. Create session tracking:
   - Initialize TodoWrite with execution stages
   - Note start time
```

### Step 2: Discovery

```bash
# Get all ready beads
bd ready --json

# Get graph analysis and execution plan
bv --robot-triage
bv --robot-plan
```

Parse the output to understand:
- Which beads are ready now
- What the dependency structure is
- Which beads must complete before others can start

### Step 3: Phase Identification

Beads naturally form phases based on dependencies:

```
Phase 1: Beads with no blockers (can start immediately)
Phase 2: Beads blocked by Phase 1 beads
Phase 3: Beads blocked by Phase 2 beads
...
```

For each phase, identify:
- Which beads belong to it
- When it can start (all blockers from previous phase done)

### Step 4: Track Computation

Within each phase, group beads into parallel tracks:

**Goal:** Beads in different tracks have NO overlapping files, so agents can work simultaneously without conflicts.

**Method:**
1. For each bead, extract file scope from:
   - `edit_locus` field if present
   - File paths mentioned in description
   - Parent directory patterns
2. Group beads whose file scopes don't overlap
3. Each group = one track

**Example:**
```
Phase 1 has 6 beads:
  bd-101, bd-102 → src/auth/**         → Track A
  bd-103, bd-104 → src/api/**          → Track B
  bd-105         → src/models/**       → Track C
  bd-106, bd-107 → tests/**            → Track D

4 tracks can run in parallel.
```

### Step 5: Spawn Workers

For each track, spawn a worker agent using the Task tool:

```python
Task(
    description=f"Worker: Track {track.name}",
    prompt=WORKER_PROMPT.format(
        track_name=track.name,
        bead_ids=track.beads,
        file_scope=track.files,
        project_path=project_path
    ),
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

**Worker Prompt Template:**

```markdown
You are a worker agent executing beads for parallel execution.

## Your Assignment
- **Track:** {track_name}
- **Beads:** {bead_ids}
- **File Scope:** {file_scope}
- **Project:** {project_path}

## Instructions

### 1. Startup
Run `/prime` to register with Agent Mail and get oriented.

### 2. Execute Each Bead

For each bead in your assignment, in order:

1. **Claim it:**
   ```
   bd update {bead_id} --status in_progress --assignee {your_name}
   ```
   Reserve files via Agent Mail. Send [CLAIMED] announcement.

2. **Implement (TDD-first):**
   - Read bead description for test requirements
   - Write tests first
   - Implement to pass tests
   - Run `ubs --staged` before commit
   - Commit with bead ID in message

3. **Close it:**
   ```
   bd close {bead_id} --reason "Completed: <summary>"
   ```
   Release reservations. Send [CLOSED] announcement.

4. **Move to next bead** in your track.

### 3. Handle Failures

If a bead fails after 3 attempts:
1. STOP trying
2. Send [BLOCKED] message:
   ```
   send_message(
       to=["Coordinator"],
       subject="[BLOCKED] {your_name} - {bead_id}",
       body_md="Failed after 3 attempts.\n\nError: {details}",
       importance="urgent"
   )
   ```
3. Continue to next bead in your track (if any)

### 4. Track Complete

When ALL beads in your track are closed (or blocked):
```
send_message(
    to=["Coordinator"],
    subject="[TRACK COMPLETE] {track_name}",
    body_md="Beads completed: {list}\nBeads blocked: {list}",
    importance="high"
)
```

Then STOP and wait. Do not pick up other work.

## Rules
1. ONLY work on beads in YOUR track
2. ONLY touch files in YOUR scope
3. TDD always — tests before implementation
4. Security gate — ubs --staged before every commit
5. 3-try limit — after 3 failures, send [BLOCKED], move on
6. Announce everything — [CLAIMED], [CLOSED], [BLOCKED], [TRACK COMPLETE]
```

### Step 6: Monitor Progress

The orchestrator monitors workers:

```python
while phase_in_progress:
    # Check Agent Mail inbox
    messages = fetch_inbox("Coordinator", limit=20, since_ts=last_check)

    for msg in messages:
        if "[TRACK COMPLETE]" in msg.subject:
            mark_track_done(extract_track(msg))
            acknowledge_message(msg.id)

        elif "[BLOCKED]" in msg.subject:
            record_blocked(msg)
            acknowledge_message(msg.id)

    # Check background task status
    for task_id in worker_tasks:
        status = TaskOutput(task_id, block=False)
        if status.completed:
            handle_worker_complete(task_id)

    # Update TodoWrite with current state
    update_progress_display()

    # Check if phase is complete
    if all_tracks_done():
        break

    # Wait before next check (avoid spinning)
    # Continue with other orchestrator work or brief pause
```

### Step 7: Phase Boundary

When all tracks in current phase complete:

```python
# 1. Run calibration
run_calibrate()  # This runs /calibrate skill

# 2. Check result
if calibration_passed:
    send_message(
        to=[ALL_WORKERS],
        subject="[PHASE COMPLETE] Phase {n}",
        body_md="Calibration passed. Proceeding to Phase {n+1}."
    )

    # Compute tracks for next phase
    next_phase_beads = get_phase_beads(n + 1)
    if next_phase_beads:
        tracks = compute_tracks(next_phase_beads)
        spawn_workers(tracks)
    else:
        # No more phases
        execution_complete()

else:
    send_message(
        to=[ALL_WORKERS],
        subject="[CALIBRATION FAILED] Phase {n}",
        body_md="Issues found. Fix beads created. Stand by."
    )

    # Create fix beads from calibration output
    create_fix_beads(calibration_issues)

    # Add fix beads to current phase and re-run
    tracks = compute_tracks(fix_beads)
    spawn_workers(tracks)
```

### Step 8: Completion

When all phases complete:

```python
send_message(
    to=[ALL_AGENTS],
    subject="[EXECUTION COMPLETE]",
    body_md="All beads closed. Execution finished."
)

# Present summary to user
print("""
## Execution Complete

**Phases:** {n} completed
**Beads:** {total} closed, {blocked} blocked
**Time:** {duration}

### Next Steps
- Run /release for final checklist
- Review any blocked beads
""")

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--agents N` | Auto | Maximum parallel agents (default: one per track) |
| `--phase N` | All | Execute only specific phase |
| `--dry-run` | false | Show tracks and plan without spawning |
| `--sequential` | false | Run one agent at a time (for debugging) |

---

## Agent Mail Protocol

| Subject | Sender | Recipients | When |
|---------|--------|------------|------|
| `[CLAIMED] bd-XXX - Title` | Worker | All agents | Starting a bead |
| `[CLOSED] bd-XXX - Title` | Worker | All agents | Finished a bead |
| `[BLOCKED] Agent - bd-XXX` | Worker | Coordinator | Stuck after 3 tries |
| `[TRACK COMPLETE] Track A` | Worker | Coordinator | All beads in track done |
| `[PHASE COMPLETE] Phase N` | Coordinator | All agents | All tracks done, calibration passed |
| `[CALIBRATION FAILED] Phase N` | Coordinator | All agents | Issues found |
| `[EXECUTION COMPLETE]` | Coordinator | All agents | All phases done |

---

## Error Handling

### Worker Gets Blocked

1. Worker sends `[BLOCKED]` message with error details
2. Worker continues to next bead in track (if any)
3. Orchestrator records blocked bead
4. At phase end, orchestrator can:
   - Create spike bead to investigate
   - Reassign to different agent
   - Escalate to user

### Calibration Fails

1. Calibration identifies issues
2. Orchestrator creates fix beads
3. Fix beads added to current phase
4. New workers spawned for fix beads
5. Re-run calibration when fixes complete

### Worker Crashes

1. Detect via TaskOutput showing unexpected completion
2. Check which beads were in progress
3. Release orphaned file reservations
4. Reassign incomplete beads to new worker

### File Conflict Detected

1. Worker's file reservation fails (conflict response)
2. Worker reports conflict to orchestrator
3. Orchestrator reassigns bead to different track or waits
