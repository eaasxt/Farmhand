# Git Pre-Commit Hook: UBS Security Scan
# --------------------------------------
# Runs UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner) on staged files before commit.
# Blocks commit if UBS finds issues (exit code > 0).
#
# Installation: Installed by Farmhand installer to ~/.config/git/hooks/pre-commit
# Skip: SKIP_UBS=1 git commit -m "..." (for emergencies only)
#
# IMPORTANT: UBS only accepts directory paths, NOT individual file paths.
# Use `ubs --staged` which creates a shadow workspace with staged files.
# Do NOT use: ubs file1.py file2.py (this will fail with usage error)
#
